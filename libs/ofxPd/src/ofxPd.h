	/// \section Initializing Pd

		/// initialize audio resources
		///
		/// set the audio latency by setting the libpd ticks per buffer:
		/// ticks per buffer * lib pd block size (always 64)
		///
		/// ie 4 ticks per buffer * 64 = buffer len of 512
		///
		/// you can call this again after loading patches & setting receivers
		/// in order to update the audio settings
		///
		/// the lower the number of ticks, the faster the audio processing
		/// if you experience audio dropouts (audible clicks), increase the
		/// ticks per buffer
		///
		/// set queued = true to use the built in ringbuffers for message and
		/// midi event passing, you will then need to call receiveMessages() and
		/// receiveMidi() in order to pass messages from the ringbuffers to your
		/// PdReceiver and PdMidiReceiver implementations
		///
		/// the queued ringbuffers are useful when you need to receieve events
		/// on a gui thread and don't want to use locking (aka the mutex)
		///

		          const int sampleRate, const int ticksPerBuffer=32,
				  bool queued=false);

		void clear();

	/// \section Adding Search Paths

		/// takes an absolute or relative path (in data folder)
		///
		/// note: fails silently if path not found
		///

		/// clear the current pd search path

	/// \section Opening Patches

		/// the pd::Patch class is a wrapper around a unique pointer to an open
		/// instance, giving you access to the $0 value for that instance
		///
		/// if you are going to use multiple instances of a patch, you will need
		/// need to keep a Patch object in order to differentiate between them
		///
		/// see src/pd/cpp/PdTypes.hpp for more info

		/// open a patch file, takes an absolute or relative path (in data folder)
		/// returns a Patch object
		pd::Patch openPatch(const std::string &patch);

		/// open a patch file using the filename and path of an existing patch
		///
		/// // open a patch, don't need pd::Patch instance object
		/// pd.openPatch("apatch.pd", "/some/path");
		///
		/// set the filename within the patch object or use a previously opened
		/// object and create a new instance
		///
		/// // open an instance of "somefile.pd", save the instance in a pd::Patch
		/// Patch p2("somefile.pd", "/some/path");    // set file and path
		/// pd.openPatch(p2);
		///
		/// // open a new instance of "somefile.pd"
		/// Patch p3 = pd.openPatch(p2);
		///
		/// p2 and p3 now refer to 2 different instances of "somefile.pd" and 
		/// p2.dollarZero() & p3.dollarZero() should now return different ids
		///

		/// use this function if you've only opened 1 instance of the given patch
